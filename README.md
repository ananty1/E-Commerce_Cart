# E-commerce by Anant

This is an e-commerce application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It features a product listing page, shopping cart functionality, and basic discount calculations.

## Features

- **Product Listing Page**: Displays a grid of products fetched from an API.
- **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add, remove, and adjust quantities of items in the cart.
- **Discounts**: Applies a fixed discount on the cart total.
- **Sticky Header**: A sticky header that remains visible at the top of the page with a cart icon.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
